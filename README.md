# Shopping

Hello Dab :)
 
So I created something like shopping website but I'm just adding the items to the "cart"
I created a selector to select the type of item (food,clothes,etc)
And another one to select the item of that type.

When I press "Add Item" I add it to the div on the page 
and I also made it when ever I press more than once the paragraph I created on the div goes from "Hamburger" to "Hamburger x2"
But if I add another item example "Coffee" and then I choose "Hamburger" again another paragraph is created

I hope I explained everything I'll talk on the chat for more info if I missed anything
